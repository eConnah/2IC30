@ This file contains a short program that puts an immediate value 
@ (pre-fixed with #) into a register, and then moves this value to
@ another register.

@ The value in R0 when the program terminates is the Exit Code.
@ This is normally 0 for successful completion of the program. Other
@ values (0-255) can be used to convey information back to the operating
@ system or the user.
